# Among-us
CLI simulation of the game Among us in C++ using tree-based data structures

$ make

    this will build the project and produce a file 'among_us' which is
    the program executable with which you can test your
    project. i.e. './among_us testfile1'.

    $ make clean

    this will erase any intermediate files produced during the compilation.

    $ make distclean

    this is the same with 'make clean' except that it also erases
    'among_us'.

#RUN

./among_us tests/<test_file.txt>
